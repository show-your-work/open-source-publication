Welcome to my first ever Open Source Publication. I want to write interesting thoughts and share them, and hopefully have some of you add to it as well.

The idea is to borrow heavily from the software worldÂ´s open source movement, but to use it for publications. Like articles or papers on Medium or publications, open source software is shared publicly for anyone to see. Unlike writing however, open source software (OSS) is open for anyone to contribute to it and make it better. Publications are lectures, whereas OSS is a _conversation_. I think it's time we all talked a little more.

Let me share some of the other exciting ways we can experience publications when building publicly and on Github.

*Engagement*
I don't know how many times I've read a seemingly amazing piece just for it to be torn to pieces in the comments. What about the comments I didn't read? How many bad ideas do I hold in my head because I haven't read the counterargument? And why do I have to go out of my way to find them? 

There's also been many times where I really want to tell the writer what I think - *you forgot to think about X, or Y is indeed true but it's irrelevant because of Z*. Comments sections barely get read, and most of us haven't built a reputation for anyone to take them seriously anyway.

But using technology like Github, I can pinpoint exactly where I disagree - or where I can help advance the argument - and make a public request to change it. The author(s) can decide to accept it or not, and I can get credit for it. 

Debates are better than monologues. 

*Version control*
Publications often will include some clunky, in the way apology for a mistake on a previous version:
> June 16 Edit: article previously misstated the amount of...

It's great that we get served the last, best, shiniest version of an article. But sometimes I'd love to see what exactly they wrote. 

*Utility*

*Transparency*


As far as I know, I'm the first person to publicly put the idea of Open Source Publications out there. Chances are I'm wrong. Tell me! If you've seen something like this before, make a PR to this publication with the evidence. I might be petty and not accept your changes, but the world will know. There's no way I can delete your attempt to correct me, and I'll have to explain why I didn't.

I hope we can turn this into part of our culture. I can see us coming up with different sets of best practices, templates, and standars. In casual conversation, you usually start with "Hello" and "How are you doing?". We might decide, by convention, to start with and overview in Intro.md and rules for contributions in Contributions.md. Or we might come up with something radically different. Or maybe different subcultures adopt their own rules and standards, much like subreddits.

Excited to hear what you have say!
